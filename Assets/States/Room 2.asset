  storyText: 'I have successfully sneaked past the guards of the hostile planet Drachma.
    I have been walking towards the light I believe is a settlement when I was crashing
    from the sky. I stumble upon a deserter who calls himself "Pyro" a fire creator
    that has the power of controlling and creating fire at will.


    Should I proceed
    to converse to him?

    1. Yes.

    2. Ignore him and move towards the settlement.'
