  storyText: 'Head on it is. I throw a grenade to the envoy of guards and boom goes
    their battle morpher - a kind of battle tank. I defeated every single one of
    them and a single guard lies on the ground before me begging for mercy.


    What
    should I do?

    1. Spare his life and interrogate him about the jumpstar spaceship
    that will help my escape from the planet?

    2. Kill him and take his battle
    morpher to the nearest settlement?'
